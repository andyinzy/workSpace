### Feeling
It's an amazing journey for working in espressif. Not only but also I can work with many friendly colleges, and the relationship here is quite simple so I can focus on my own work.

An impact to my mindset is: Try to consider more for customers. Due to content of evaluative plan is mostly about getting familiar with work details in the process of finishing example, I was not often to get in touch with customers directly, but that doesn't means I was totally don't care the demands of customers. After by accepting a host of reviewing proposals, I gradually find that considering more requirements told from a customer perspective . Also, develop a readable API means more friendly experience. For those examples which demonstrates usage of API that we should make code and comments more readable.
