## Perception about work
Working in espressif is an amazing journey. Not only I could learn a multitude of techniques but also have a chance to work with many friendly colleagues. The relationship here is quite simple so I can focus on my work.

An impact to my mindset is: Try to consider more for customers. In the process of finishing example, due to content of evaluative plan is mostly about getting familiar with peripherals' technique, I was not often to contact with customers directly, but it doesn't means no need to achieve the demands of customers. After by accepting a host of reviewing proposals, I gradually find out that considering more requirements told from a customer perspective will effectively benefit for our products. Also, develop a readable API means more friendly experience for customers. Especially for those examples which demonstrates usage of API that we should make code and comments more readable.
