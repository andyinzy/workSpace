# Summary

## Work details
In probation period, most of my work is getting familiar with the entire system and workflow, including to know how do build system works and how to use tools such as git, CI, debugging tools.

My mentor is Michael. He focusses on SPI peripherals, basically I'm working on SPI peripheral as well. In the process of learning and practicing, I did things as following:

**Get familar with:**
- Git: branch control, rebase, release version.
- Gitlab: how to create MR and review.
- Debugging tools: gdb, JTAG.
- CI: job runner, bot test.
- Build system: how compilor works.
- FreeRTOS: semaphore, mutex, dual-core task control.
- Periperals: timer group interrupt service routine, DAC, ADC.
- SPI: specific transmission structure of master/slave.

**Already finished example/test:**
- Software controlled wave generator based on DAC and TimerGroup.
- A spi slave diverse length bytes transaction unit-test.

**Participate in training as following/What do I get:**
- Project fundamentals: try to think from a brand new viewpoint to IoT and semiconductor field.
- Chip introducion/peripherals: more familiar with a series of peripherals.
- Git workflow: learn a lot of details about git. 
- TCP IP: know more about 3 handshakes / 4 waves.
- Build system: figure out how do GCC compilor works.
- FreeRTOS: get more details about semaphore, mutex, spinlock etc.

## Perception about work
Working in espressif is just like an amazing journey. Not only I could learn a multitude of techniques but also have a chance to work with many friendly colleagues. The relationship here is quite simple so I can focus on my work.

An impact to my mindset is: Try to consider more for customers. In the process of finishing functional example, due to the content of evaluative plan is mostly about getting familiar with peripherals' technique, I was not often to contact with customers directly, but it doesn't means no need to achieve the their demands. After by accepting a host of reviewing proposals, I gradually find out that considering more requirements told from customers' perspective will effectively benefit for our products. Also, develop a readable API means more friendly experience for customers. Especially for those examples which demonstrates usage of API that we should make code and comments more readable.

## Shortage / Point to improve
Lack of timely feedback: When I stuck at some technical points, I perfer to try to analyse it or search it on Internet by myself instead of asking someone. It may save not only my time, but also others'. But it makes me easier to forget making feedback report to my manager/mentor. I think I will try to communicate more with them after I finished each certain outcome in stages.
